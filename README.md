Webper utilizes the [Sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) library, an API designed for image conversion and resizing. Webper serves as a graphical user interface (GUI) for utilizing the functionality provided by the Sharp library. 
It simplifies the process of converting and resizing images, making it accessible to users without requiring them to interact directly with the library's API.
